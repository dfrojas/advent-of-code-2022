# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) using different programming languages. Among them Rust, C++, Python, Go or TypeScript.

**Why in different programming languages?** Although my forte is Python, I'm just curious about other programming languages. My main interest is to learn Rust but trying other technologies is fun too

I'd like to solve all the problems, but one exercise per day it's a lot and December is a busy month. I'll try my best to complete them all.

P.S: I'm not an expert in Rust, C++, Go or TypeScript (the languages likely used here) please do not judge my ignorance in those languages :) If there is something to improve or more idiomatic way to solve a problem, please let me know.
